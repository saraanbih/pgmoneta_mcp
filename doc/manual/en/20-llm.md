# Local LLM

**pgmoneta_mcp** can be used together with a local large language model (LLM) so that
users can explore pgmoneta backups in natural language without sending prompts or
backup metadata to a cloud service.

## What is a local LLM?

A local LLM is an artificial intelligence model that runs entirely on your own
hardware. Unlike cloud-based services, all data processing, storage, and
inference stays within your private infrastructure. This ensures privacy and
data sovereignty while providing natural language capabilities for database
management.

## Functionality

The local LLM integration is built around three parts:

* The **pgmoneta MCP server**, which exposes pgmoneta operations as MCP tools
* A local **LLM runtime**, which hosts a tool-capable model
* The **agent** layer, which sends prompts to the model, executes requested tools,
  and returns a final answer

The overall flow looks like this:

``` text
User prompt
    |
    v
Local LLM runtime (Ollama or llama.cpp)
    |
    v
pgmoneta_mcp tools
    |
    v
pgmoneta
```

## Comparison

When choosing a local runtime for **pgmoneta_mcp**, consider the following trade-offs
between ease of use and granular control.

### Runtime comparison

| Feature | Ollama | llama.cpp |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Installation** | Single binary / installer | Download or build binary |
| **Model Management** | Built-in CLI (`pull`, `list`) | Manual download of `.gguf` files |
| **Ease of Use** | High (recommended for beginners) | Advanced (manual configuration) |
| **Control** | Automatic hardware detection | Granular threading/GPU/RAM control |
| **Performance** | Excellent (balanced) | Maximum (optimized for specific hardware** |

### Pros and Cons

**Ollama**

**Pros:**

* **Simple installation**: A single binary or system package — no compilation required.
* **Built-in model management**: Download, list, and switch models using familiar CLI commands (`ollama pull`, `ollama list`, `ollama run`), similar to how Docker manages images.
* **Automatic hardware detection**: Detects your CPU, RAM, and GPU automatically and selects optimal defaults.
* **Runs as a persistent service**: Works as a background daemon, so it survives terminal sessions and integrates cleanly into system startup.
* **Large ecosystem**: Well-documented with an active community and many supported models listed at [ollama.com/library](https://ollama.com/library).

**Cons:**

* **Less hardware control**: You cannot easily override the number of GPU layers, thread counts, or memory layout without advanced configuration.
* **Abstraction layer overhead**: Ollama adds a management layer on top of llama.cpp. For most users this is beneficial, but for advanced hardware tuning it can be limiting.

**llama.cpp**

**Pros:**

* **Granular hardware control**: Expose and tune parameters like `--n-gpu-layers` (how many layers to offload to GPU), `--threads` (CPU thread count), and `--ctx-size` (context window size) to match your exact hardware.
* **Portable and scriptable**: `llama-server` is a standalone binary that can be embedded in shell scripts, Docker containers, or automation pipelines without a daemon.
* **Native OpenAI API**: Exposes the standard `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint directly, making it compatible with any OpenAI-compatible client.
* **Widest quantization support**: Supports every quantization format (`Q2_K`, `Q4_K_M`, `Q8_0`, `IQ3_M` etc.), giving full control over the size vs. quality trade-off.

**Cons:**

* **No built-in model registry**: You must manually find, download, and organize `.gguf` model files from sources like Hugging Face.
* **No model management**: No built-in equivalent of `ollama list` or `ollama pull`. You manage model files and versions yourself.
* **Manual startup**: Requires a precise launch command each time (`--model`, `--port`, `--ctx-size`, etc.), with no automatic restart on failure.

## Recommended models

When choosing an LLM for **pgmoneta_mcp**, keep these key concepts in mind regardless of which provider you choose:

1. **Instruct vs. Base**: You must use a model fine-tuned for instruction following or chat (usually labeled `Instruct` or `Chat`). Base models are not trained to follow instructions and will fail at tool calling.
2. **Hardware Limits**: The model's listed file size indicates the *minimum* RAM needed simply to load its weights. Actual runtime usage will be 20-30% higher because the runtime allocates memory for context caching and inference buffers.

### Understanding model names

Whether you are pulling a model via Ollama or downloading a `.gguf` file for `llama.cpp`, the model name usually encodes its size and compression level:

``` text
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Q4_K_M
       ^^^           ^^^^^^
        |               |
        |               +-- Quantization level (Qy)
        +-- Parameter count (xB)
```

**Parameter count (`xB`)**

The `xB` part (e.g. `3B`, `7B`, `8B`) stands for *billions of parameters* — the number of internal connections in the neural network. A larger model uses more disk space and RAM. In return, you get better **tool calling accuracy** — the model is more likely to pick the right tool, pass correct arguments, and reason correctly about the results.

For **pgmoneta_mcp**, tool calling is what matters most. A model that is too small may:
- Call the wrong tool or skip tools entirely
- Pass incorrect arguments (wrong server name, wrong backup ID)
- Fail to follow multi-step instructions

Start with a `7B` or `8B` model as a baseline. If the model repeatedly calls wrong tools or produces incorrect results, move to a larger model. A `3B` model needs roughly half the RAM of a `7B` model, but at a cost in reasoning quality.

**Quantization level (`Qy`)**

Models are compressed ("quantized") to reduce memory usage. The `Q` suffix indicates the compression level. `Q4_K_M` (4-bit quantization) is the recommended starting point for most setups — it uses roughly half the RAM of an uncompressed model with only a minor drop in reasoning quality.

### Verified models

The following models are verified for tool-calling performance. Sizes are based on the recommended Q4 quantization.

| Model | Size (Disk) | RAM Needed | Performance |
| :---- | :--- | :--------- | :---- |
| Qwen 2.5 (0.5B) | ~0.4 GB | ~1 GB | Minimal footprint |
| Llama 3.2 (3B) | ~2.0 GB | ~4 GB | Fast and lightweight |
| Qwen 2.5 (3B) | ~1.9 GB | ~4 GB | High speed, decent quality |
| Llama 3.1 (8B) | ~4.7 GB | ~8 GB | Balanced default choice |
| Qwen 2.5 (7B) | ~4.7 GB | ~8 GB | Excellent tool-calling accuracy |
| Mistral (7B) | ~4.1 GB | ~8 GB | Solid general-purpose model |
| Mixtral (8x7B) | ~26.0 GB | ~32 GB | High quality, high hardware cost |

Examples of provider-specific model names can be found in the Ollama and llama.cpp sections below.
